#' Current ClinVarbitration policy version
#'
#' The identifier pins the policy semantics adapted from Centre for Population
#' Genomics ClinVarbitration 2.2.11 (upstream commit
#' `658b9f241eb2d43aa11214b153b19c1e18a16337`) and records that decisions are
#' grouped per disease rather than only per variation. The identifier has no
#' package-local suffix: the view names, rather than a speculative `v1`, state
#' whether the output is disease-scoped or allele-scoped.
#'
#' @return A character scalar.
#' @export

#' ClinVarbitration policy SQL
#'
#' Returns DuckDB views implementing the supported policy over
#' `clinvar_disease_submissions`. The policy bins submitted classifications,
#' excludes unknown bins and the upstream qualified Illumina benign exclusion,
#' optionally applies profile-specific submitter exclusions, prefers evidence
#' evaluated from 2016 onward while always retaining expert-panel and practice
#' guideline evidence, and applies the 60/20 majority rule. The disease-level
#' and allele-level views both reproduce the upstream strong-review rule: the
#' first retained practice-guideline or expert-panel classification in source
#' order is decisive.
#'
#' `clinvar_policy_pathogenic_alleles` is the disease-specific pathogenic or
#' likely-pathogenic join surface for downstream Rduckhts/DuckHTS annotation.
#' It does not perform VEP or PM5 computation.
#'
#' @param policy_version Exact supported policy version. See
#'   [rclinvarbitration_policy_version()].
#' @return A named character vector of DuckDB `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`
#'   statements.
