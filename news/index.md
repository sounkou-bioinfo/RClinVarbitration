# Changelog

## RClinVarbitration 0.1.1

- Add `submitter_exclusions` to the XML-derived Parquet exporter. Direct
  exclusions are normalized case-insensitively, combined with a selected
  named profile, and applied without deleting imported source
  submissions.

- Replace the full-release executable README with a concise quick start
  and an explicit comparison with upstream ClinVarbitration.

- Add native x86-64 Windows extension builds using Rtools-provided
  libxml2, zlib, and target-aware `pkg-config`; retain Linux, macOS, and
  webR builds. Runtime artifact selection now matches exact DuckDB
  platform metadata and includes both `windows_amd64` and R-devel’s
  `windows_amd64_mingw` identities.

- Add
  [`rclinvarbitration_download_clinvar()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/RClinVarbitration/reference/rclinvarbitration_download_clinvar.md)
  for checksum-validated current or monthly archived VCV XML downloads
  and optional flat-file validation inputs. Download URL, digest, and
  source byte size can flow into the release catalogue.

- Add `clinvar_hpo_terms`, `clinvar_literature_links`,
  `clinvar_semantic_documents`, and disease-aware
  `clinvar_gene_summaries` for semantic retrieval, gene panels,
  literature review, DuckLake publication, and VariantStory integration.

- Add pkgdown vignettes for the complete arbitration algorithm,
  storage/cache lifecycle and measured full-release performance, and
  semantic/DuckLake/ VariantStory integration. Add a rendered
  `docs/ERRATA.md` audit of intentional deviations and observed
  XML/flat/upstream differentials.

- Execute the pinned upstream TSV algorithm on exact March 2026 flat
  inputs: all 4,125,389 keys and values match the package reproducer.
  Classify all 377 XML/flat key or value differences with source-row
  receipts, and quantify sample/method/observed-data/consequence XML
  structure coverage.

- Add release-differential tests for disease keys, SCV replacement,
  withdrawn assertions, compound alleles, and mitochondrial locations,
  plus curated real HPO and PubMed context projections.

- Add experimental webR/WebAssembly support. The package now builds its
  version-matched DuckDB extension as an Emscripten side module and has
  a browser smoke test that loads it and imports the compressed VCV
  fixture.

- Project compact parser rows with the package-owned
  `rclinvar_json_field()` scalar rather than DuckDB’s separately
  downloadable JSON extension. Imports now require no extension
  download, including in browser/webR runtimes.

- Remove the premature local `v1` policy suffix; preserve the pinned
  `cpg-clinvarbitration-2.2.11` identifier, source-order strong-review
  rule, and separate disease- and allele-level decision views.

- Add Parquet exporters for the VCV-derived allele policy and for
  direct, SQL-only reproduction of ClinVarbitration from versioned NCBI
  flat-file archives, plus a retained differential script for published
  Zenodo releases.

- Retain imported SCV source order for deterministic strong-review
  decisions.

- Bundle exact `C_STRUCT_UNSTABLE` extension artifacts for DuckDB
  `v1.5.0` through `v1.5.4`, selected from the enabled connection’s
  engine version.

- Replace generic XML node/edge/statement persistence with a one-pass,
  ClinVar-specific entity scan and focused VCV, allele, location, gene,
  RCV, SCV, condition, observation, citation, attribute, and
  evidence-text relations. Staging now stores one JSON-backed row per
  selected entity and requires no release-wide EAV grouping.
  Release-scale tables use logical keys without memory-resident ART
  indexes, and each projection commits separately; the release catalogue
  marks completion and failed imports clean partial rows.

- Add `clinvar_disease_aggregates` and `clinvar_disease_submissions` as
  direct RCV- and SCV-level disease-policy inputs, with canonical
  disease identifiers selected independently of the complete retained
  cross-reference relation.

- Add the `cpg-clinvarbitration-2.2.11` SQL policy, configurable
  submitter-blinding profiles, and `clinvar_policy_pathogenic_alleles`
  as the disease-specific P/LP join surface for Rduckhts/DuckHTS.

- Execute the README quick start against the bundled real VCV fixture.
  The separately receipted full-release benchmark remains file-backed
  and does not rerun during README rendering.

## RClinVarbitration 0.1.0

- First public release.
- Added a package-owned DuckDB C extension with
  `clinvar_xml_statements(path)`, a single-threaded libxml2 forward scan
  of ClinVar VCV XML and XML.GZ releases.
- Added semantic SQL materialization for ordered XML nodes, edges,
  literals, and discovery text, with a real NCBI VCV XML.GZ fixture.
- The first artifact supports exactly DuckDB `v1.5.3` on Unix-like
  hosts; it fails closed for other engine versions.
